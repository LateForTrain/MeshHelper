# MeshHelper

MeshHelper is a standalone companion Android app that connects to the official Meshtastic Android 
app via its AIDL interface (IMeshService) to send and receive data over the mesh network. It 
integrates custom sensor readings or other helper functionality, using Jetpack Compose for the UI.

This project is open-source under GPL-3.0 (see LICENSE), as it interfaces with Meshtastic (also 
GPL-3.0). It does **not** include any Meshtastic code in the repository to respect licensing 
and keep the repo clean.
